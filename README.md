This repository demonstrates a common C++ bug involving multiple pointers referencing the same memory location. Modifying the value through one pointer affects all pointers pointing to that address. The bug.cpp file shows the erroneous code, while bugSolution.cpp provides a solution to avoid this issue by creating copies of data instead of manipulating the original memory location. The solution illustrates best practices for pointer handling and data integrity in C++ programming.
